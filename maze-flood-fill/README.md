Generate animations of mazes being flood-filled. There are implementations in JavaScript for viewing in a browser (see `index.html`), and in Python for generating animated gifs (see `frames.py`).

The maze images were generated using the `pylib-mazer` code in this repository:

    pylib-mazer/scripts/make_png_maze.py -r 164 -c 264 -m 4 -o maze.png
