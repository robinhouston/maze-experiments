Some experimental code for counting the number of mazes and weave mazes of particular sizes,
using Kirchhoff's matrix tree theorem. The fast numerical stuff uses numpy, though there are
also some experiments (not very useful in fact, I think, but interesting to have tried) using
symbolic expressions and the Mahajan-Vinay determinant algorithm to generate polynomial
expressions that actually represent all the possible mazes in algebraic form.
